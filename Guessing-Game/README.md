"One in a Thousand"

C++ program for number guessing game. The user thinks of a number between 1 and 1000 and the program asks questions to figure out what the number is (e.g., “Is the number you are thinking of less than 230?”). The correct number should be passed as a command-line parameter to the program (if the true number were supposed to be 473, then you would run the program with the command “guess.exe 473”). If the provided parameter is not between 1 and 1000 inclusive, the program will output an error message: “Invalid number!” and exit. The program is able to identify the number after asking no more than ten questions. Once the program has determined the number (say for example it was 473), it will print to standard output the following message: “Your number is 473!” and exit.
